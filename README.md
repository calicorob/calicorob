## Introduction

Hi, my name is [Robert Currie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertarthurcurrie/), i'm a 27 year data old data scientist from Toronto, ON. 

My background:
* I graduated from Queen's University with a B.A.Sc. in Chemical Engineering in 2016. 
* I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a MASc. in Chemical Engineering in 2019.

I got interested in data science and machine learning while working on my Masters' Degree at the University of Waterloo.

## Work 
### University of Waterloo

At the University of Waterloo, I primiarily worked on:
* Developing non-linear regression tools for estimating the reaction kinetic parameters of the catalysts we were studying in the lab. 
* Designing and modelling a novel membrane reactor for CO<sub>2</sub> methanation into renewable natural gas and assessing the feasibility of a renewable natural gas production facility.

My regression and modelling work has been used in [4 publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J2R_w0UAAAAJ&hl=en).

### JANA Corporation

After graudating from Waterloo, I moved into a data science role at JANA Corporaton. 

At JANA, I use data science, machine learning and reliability engineering to predict the risk of failure of the components of our client's installed natural gas transmission and distribution asset base. 

### Projects 
When i'm not at work, I like to pursue outside projects to further my understanding in data science and machine learning:
* I developed a [Pokemon battle simulator](https://github.com/calicorob/PokemonSimulator) to predict the outcome of Generation 1 Pokemon battles. 
* I used Monte Carlo simulations to find the optimal strategy to win a [dice game](https://github.com/calicorob/DiceGame) my friends invented.
* I scraped thousands of Curling game scores to build [Curling analytics](https://github.com/calicorob/CurlingAnalytics) for use in my own competitive curling career. 

## Other Interesting Stuff
* I like to write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@robert.art.currie) about my side projects. 
* I participate in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/robertcurrie) competitions and community whenever I can.
* When i'm not crunching numbers, I enjoy working out, golfing and curling.
